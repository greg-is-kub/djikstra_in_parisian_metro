# Cpp_M1_Project
finding its own path through paris metropolitan

Hi ! 

If i'm here it means that i haven't lost my way through Paris infamous metropolitan.
This was a project of my first year of M1 graduation. I did this project on windows so if you are on linux the paths might not match.

This repository is an example of code I have done by myself. you can find the subjectin "CppAvanceTPprojet_en.pdf".

It might contain superfluous cpp files that coud have been regrouped , i wanted to keep 1hpp/1cpp file convention.

In order to run the program , run the following commands on the terminal from the main repertory.

make
RATPerdu data/s.csv data/c.csv STATION_DEPART STATIONS_ARRIVEE

STATION_DEPART and STATION_ARRIVEE are station id found in data/s.csv

Thank you for your attention,

Gr√©goire Kubler
